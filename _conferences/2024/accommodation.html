  <h2>Accommodation</h2>
  <p>There are several options for accommodations near the conference site at the University of North Texas College of Music (415 Avenue C, Denton, TX  76203). 
  </p>

  <h4>Campus Residence Halls</h4>
  <p>The closest and least-expensive housing option is in a residence hall on campus, where you may book one of two room types:
  </p>
  <dl class="list">
  <dt>Single bedroom with shared bath - $124</dt>
  <dd>Single occupancy rooms connected by a bathroom between two bedrooms. Pursuant to fire code, suite bathroom doors are not able to be locked. Occupants in both single occupancy rooms on either side of the bathroom are able to access the other suited bedroom, in effect creating a 2-person suite. 
  </dd>
  <dt>Single bedroom with en-suite bath - $184</dt>
  <dd>Single occupancy room with connected private bath.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>Reservations must be made via the <a href="https://bit.ly/MECHousing2024">campus housing registration form</a>, and payment must be completed (via the same link) by May 1. UNT's Campus Housing requires guests to reserve a room for the block of four nights that coincide with the conference, regardless of the actual length of the guest's stay; check in is on May 19th and checkout is May 23rd. The rate for a single room is $184 for all four nights, and the rate for a private room with a shared bathroom is $124 for all four nights.
</p>
<p>Attendees staying in on-campus housing must supply their own linens (sheets, towels, blankets, pillows, etc.).
</p>

<h4>Hotels</h4>
<p>Denton has several national chain hotels, most of which are several miles from campus. While these are not easily walkable, rideshare services are readily available in town, including GoZone, an inexpensive corner-to-corner rideshare service that is part of the Denton County Transit Authority. We recommend booking hotels early due to demand surrounding graduation ceremonies. User reviews via Google or other booking sites can be highly informative in determining the quality of a hotel.
</p>
<p>We have secured a $107/night rate for a room block at the Best Western Crown Chase Inn & Suites located at 2450 Brinker Road, Denton, TX  76208. Please use the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/UNT-Libraries" target="blank">dedicated reservation link</a> or call (940)387-1000 to book at this rate. The hotel is located at 2450 Brinker Rd, Denton, TX 76208.
