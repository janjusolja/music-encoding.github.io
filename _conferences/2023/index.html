    <p>The Music Encoding Conference is the annual meeting of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) community and all who are interested in the digital representation of music. In 2023, the MEC will be held jointly with the TEI.</p>

    <p>The conference theme - Encoding Cultures - invites us to think about the need to encode different cultural realms â€” not only written musical and literary cultures, but also oral cultures, the cultures of underrepresented communities, and even cultural practices beyond language and music, such as dance, theater, and film. In coming together to identify and discuss the commonalities and differences between our two coding communities, we aim to discover new methods and new approaches to encoding culture in all its forms.</p>

    <p>Visit <a href="https://teimec2023.uni-paderborn.de/">the conference website</a> to view the full details.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://teimec2023.uni-paderborn.de/cfp.html">Call for Proposals</a> is now available.</p>
