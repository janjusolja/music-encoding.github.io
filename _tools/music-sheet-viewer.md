[Music Sheet Viewer](http://www.partitionnumerique.com/music-sheet-viewer-wordpress-plugin/) is an open-source WordPress plugin that allows the display of one or more music sheet fragments of full scores written in MEI, MusicXML, ABC or PAE ([RISM](http://rism-ch.org) notation), in a post or page of a WordPress site. The code is entered using a WordPress shortcode tag or a dedicated Block, and the resulting score is displayed as if it had been natively supported by the browser. It is powered by [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org), and provides many Verovio features without having to write one single line of code: all the JavaScript code is generated on the page.

The main features are: automatic resize to fit the available content, display in any [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org) font, code entered either inline or from a file, score playback and notes highlighting thanks to an enhancement of the [RISM MIDI Player](https://github.com/rism-ch/midi-player), automatic page turn when played, responsive code.
