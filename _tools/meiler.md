The [MEI LilyPond Engraving Refinement](https://github.com/rettinghaus/MEILER) (MEILER) is a set of XSLT stylesheets to render MEI files with the help of the [LilyPond Engine](http://lilypond.org). This allows making heavy use of the layout attributes and parameters available in MEI.

Possible LilyPond output formats are PDF, PNG and SVG. It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rettinghaus/MEILER). You may have a look at some test files [here](https://github.com/rettinghaus/MEILER/tree/master/tests) and [here](https://github.com/rettinghaus/mei-test-set/), to get an impression of its capabilities. Also, there's a [poster](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15014.93760) available.
