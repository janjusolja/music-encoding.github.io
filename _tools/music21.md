[music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/) is a simple set of tools for computer-aided music analysis.

music21 builds on pre-existing frameworks and technologies such as Humdrum, MusicXML, and MIDI, but uses an object-oriented framework that makes it easier to handle complex data. At the same time, music21 aims to keep its code clear and transparent and simplify reusing existing code.
